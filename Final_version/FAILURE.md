# Failure in project
Along with this project,

From overall part, there exists a lag time of approximately 15 minutes before the code can resume the reading of the tweets whenever the code is runned continuously multiple times. (Limitation of using the user’s authentication key)

In milestone1, we faced the coding problem to scraping data from Twitter API in part A.
Previously, the team’s code could only  read tweets from the Twitter API at a limit of approximately 900 requests  due to page limitations on tweepy.cursur (search_text).  To resolve this issue, the team utilized  tweepy.Stream as a solution to this problem.

In milestone2, the problem is it was a challenge to configure the code such that the trendiness of phrases as well as words could be calculated.
